# Automatic schedule adaption

TODO

Chainsail automagically finds appropriate schedules via an iterative algorithm which results in approximatively constant acceptance rates between neighboring distributions.
This algorithm is based on work by Prof. Michael Habeck (see these [two](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v22/habeck12.html) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00053)).
