# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Chainsail

TODO

Chainsail currently implements a naive version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with only a basic automatic adaption of the integration step size, a unit mass matrix and a fixed number of integration steps per HMC step. 
A better local sampling algorithm will be implemented in later stages of the project.
